For lexing the code:
The code is split into separate tokens, and they are grouped together to form statements.
The code is split into operators, identifiers, number literals, whitespace, and groups (quotes, parentheses, brackets/braces, etc)
"Operators" are split further into actual operators when possible.
Number literals can have the following syntax:
  123
  123_000_000
  123.0
  123e4
  123.0i
  0b1101.0
  0o123.0
  0x123abCD
Any token starting with a number that does not follow this syntax throws an error.
Whitespace segments not containing a line feed are ignored.
Code inside groups are left untouched to be evaluated later.

These are just my ideas. Feel free to make changes/suggestions.
